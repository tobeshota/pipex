'Cause you had a bad day
'Cause you had a bad day
And I don't need no carrying on
And I don't need no carrying on
And how does it feel one more time?
Had a bad day
Had a bad day
Had a bad day
Oh, you and I
So where is the passion when you need it the most?
Sometimes the system goes on the blink And the whole thing, it turns out wrong
The camera don't lie
The camera don't lie
The point is they laugh at what you say
Well you need a blue sky holiday
Where is the moment we needed the most?
You had a bad day
You had a bad day
You had a bad day
You had a bad day
You had a bad day
You had a bad day
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
You kick up the leaves, and the magic is lost They tell me your blue sky's faded to gray They tell me your passion's gone away And I don't need no carrying on
You might not make it back and you know That you could be well, oh, that strong And I'm not wrong (yeah, yeah, yeah)
You say you don't know
You say you don't know
You say you don't know
You see what you like
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You stand in the line just to hit a new low
You tell me don't lie
You tell me your life's been way off line
You tell me, "don't lie"
You tell me, "don't lie"
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You work at a smile, and you go for a ride You had a bad day
You work at a smile, and you go for a ride You had a bad day
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You're coming back down, and you really don't mind You had a bad day
You're faking a smile with the coffee to go
You're falling to pieces every time
You're taking one down
You're taking one down
You're taking one down
