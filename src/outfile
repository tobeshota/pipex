    23	You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
    24	You kick up the leaves, and the magic is lost They tell me your blue sky's faded to gray They tell me your passion's gone away And I don't need no carrying on
    25	You might not make it back and you know That you could be well, oh, that strong And I'm not wrong (yeah, yeah, yeah)
    26	You say you don't know

    41	You're coming back down and you really don't mind
    42	You're coming back down, and you really don't mind You had a bad day

    45	You're taking one down
    46	You're taking one down
    47	You're taking one down
